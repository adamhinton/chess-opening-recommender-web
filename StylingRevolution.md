# Purpose

I want to totally re-do the styling and UI/UX of this project.

We are throwing out my original custom tailwind classes. We will incorporate and heavily use ShadCN.

# Styling Specs

- Responsive
- Accessible
- Light/dark mode
- NOTE: If you're writing much tailwind at all, you're doing it wrong. This will be a ShadCN heavy project. I give you full authority to install any ShadCN component you need at any time.
- Take time to make this beautiful, bold, lovely.
- Transitions, animations
- IMPORTANT: Semantic HTML. When you do need to make your own elements, try to use the semantic ones.

# Steps

**Step 1**: Rip out all previous styling and components
**Step 2**: Install ShadCN and set up the provider
**Step 3**: Flesh out index.css with better styling and themes
**Step 4**: Re-work styling from the ground up; this will be split in to separate parts

- Make sure we have a header
