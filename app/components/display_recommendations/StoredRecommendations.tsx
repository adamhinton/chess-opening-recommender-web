// This lives in /display_recommendations

// If the user has more than one set of recommendations saved (by username and color), it displays a quick list of them to choose from

// Contains trash button to delete; and clicking anywhere else displays that one

// This should be source-agnostic; right now it'll just read from localStorage but a stretch goal is to hook this up to a DB
