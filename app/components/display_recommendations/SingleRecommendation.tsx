// ===============================
// Displays one of the chess openings that our AI model recommends they try

// These will be organizd in RecommendationsContainer.tsx; by ECO letter, then by ECO number, then by opening name

// This component will be fairly minimal; maybe just the opening name hyperlinked to its lichess URL (we already have a helper function to generate the URL)

// I lean towards not advising the user of confidence levels/expected scores etc, since those are very hard to pinpoint on the level of individual openings; but can revisit this
