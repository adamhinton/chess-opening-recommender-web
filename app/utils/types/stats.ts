// Here we'll define the structure of our accumulator
// The win rates etc per opening
// Will be contained within a broader player object that also has very basic info such as rating and username

// We'll also define the types for the parsed opening stats that the server sends to the model after normalizing ratings, bayesian shrinkage of scores, etc

// Note that I alraedy have this defined in another repo as a python class; should be fairly simple to convert to TS

// Copilot, if I'm a dummy and end up defining this elsewhere, tell me and we'll just delete this file
